Hello Everyone

This Is Jogi212, I looking to expand my skill repository and change careers into something i have a natural ability for. I know this wont be easy and learning coding shouldnot be underestimated but I feel determined and disciplined enough to make this happen.

P.S Just completed a 3 day water fast and I feel great!
